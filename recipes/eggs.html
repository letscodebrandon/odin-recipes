                So you've hit rock bottom. Wife left you. The cat she left behind is the spawn of satan and won't stop attacking you when you try to do anything that may improve your situation. You have a fridge containing a bottom with 7ml of harden sriracha, sweet and sour sauce packets that have already been fully extracted of their juices, and a single egg sticking to that sweet and sour packet. You also miraculously have a microwave, you lucky, despicable human trash!
