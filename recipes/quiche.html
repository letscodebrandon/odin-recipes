    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees.</li>
        <p><em>wait, we're preheating before we do any other shit?</em></p>
        <li>In large bowl mix olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder and hot sauce.</li>
        <li>Add potatoes to bowl and allow to marinate for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Using a strainer and another bowl, drain the potatoes. Collect all remaining sauce in one bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Coat baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Spread potatoes evenly in baking dish and bake for 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fry bacon and set aside to drain.</li>
        <li>Using the bacon grease, brown the chicken cubes and add them to the remaining sauce. Coat the chicken cubes evenly in
        the sauce.</li>
        <p>holy fuck is this longest recipe ever or what? You're going to want to squeeze a 1-2-hour nap in here somewhere</p>
        <li>Once potatoes are done, spread the chicken on top. Bake for 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Crumble the bacon, grate the cheese, and chop the green onions.</li>
        <li>Layer the cheese, bacon, and half of the green onions and bake for 3 - 5 minutes more, until the cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Add fresh green onions before serving.</li>
        <li>give yourself a little pat on the buttooshka (sp?) because you deserve it after this Thanksgiving-dinner-level-casserole recipe-what-the-flying-shit-tickets</li>
